I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland - College Park, pursuing research under the supervision of Dr. Yaser Yacoob.
I possess a keen interest in computer vision, AI, and machine learning, especially in generative models (image/video), latent space exploration/ manipulation, and media forensics. Currently, my research focus is on extending image generative models temporally enabling face video re-enactment related applications through latent space exploration.
